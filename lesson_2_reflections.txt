What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a hidden directory where git stores all of the commits and files
needed by git. Initiating a repository is the only way to start making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Repository contains saved commits. Working directory contains all the current
files in the project. The staging area allows you to select which files in the
working dir you want to make commits from. It allows you to be more precise
in which files to make commits from.
