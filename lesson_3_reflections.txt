When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
When you want to work on the project from multiple locations or when others are
contributing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To prevent undesired changes to your local commits that others may have pushed
to the remote repository.
