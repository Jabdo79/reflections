When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
When you want to work on the project from multiple locations or when others are
contributing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To prevent undesired changes to your local commits that others may have pushed
to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of repositories on github. Clones are copies of full
repositories with at least one copy locally. Branches are two or more different
sets of commits originating from a parent commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
You would be able to run git diff on the current remote head and your local
head. Allowing you to identify the changes made.
